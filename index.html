                            <p> Today is Friday April 8th 2021, my toughest day of the week today as I have both a research meeting and two 1 hour 20 min class blocks in CSE 110 and CSE 190. </p>
                            <p> Full day means no breakfast sadly </p>

                            <p> Though it is work, my research meetings are pretty pleasent as I have a fun and cooperative team. We talked about courses, waitlists, our break,
                                and next steps for our project. I am tasked with wireframing the mental health screening page and creating the CSS guidelines.

                                the establishment always brightens my mood
